* What's this?

  The great org-habit module lacks a way to handle a very common type of habits, those that can/may/must be executed only on certain weekdays.
  There exist several workarounds like creating a habit for each day of interest, but they are less flexible and spoil the beauty of Org.

  This little enhancement aims to fill the gap. It's a fork of the original org-habit module and most of the internals are left untouched.

* What works
  
  The desired minimum.

* Installation

  As simple as putting the org-habit-plus.el into the load path and adding =org-habit-plus= to the =org-modules= list.

* How it works

  TODO
